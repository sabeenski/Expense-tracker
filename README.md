Having worked with React/Redux for sometime, I wanted to do a refresher on my knowledge of Javascript. This is a simple expense tracker/ calculation App that covers the fundamental but important knowledge on DOM Manipulation.

## Features
- Users can add their incomes.
- Users can add their expenses.
- Incomes and expenses are shown in lists as a history.
- Users can view their total balance based on how much they earned and spent.
- When any item is deleted off the list, the income/expense + balance containers are updated simultaneously.
